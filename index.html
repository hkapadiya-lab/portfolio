          <h1>Hi, I'm Hardee Kapadiya!</h1>
          <p>
            I'm an Indian girl who moved to the USA, bringing my roots, colors, and creativity with me! I’ve been passionate about art since I was a kid—drawing, painting, and losing myself in creative adventures.<br>
            My journey includes winning school drawing competitions, learning classical mehndi from my elders, and making memories with every new creation.<br>
            Now, I combine all my skills: henna art, drawing, photography, and YouTube—sharing my craft and culture with even more people!
          </p>

            <li>Winner of multiple art and mehndi competitions</li>
            <li>Professional Henna artist with a flourishing side business</li>
            <li>Specialized in drawing and portrait art since childhood</li>

        <h2>Henna</h2>
        <p>
          Henna has always been close to my heart. I started learning as a little girl in India, copying my mother's designs and getting mehndi on every family occasion.<br>
          For a while, studies and life kept me busy, but when I came back to the USA, I picked up my cone again—and people loved my art!<br>
          Soon it became my little business. Now, I get to make people feel special with unique mehndi designs, and it brings so much joy (and a bit of extra pocket money!).

        <h2>Drawing</h2>
        <p>
          Drawing has been my escape, my passion, and my happiness since childhood. From sketching cartoon characters to creating detailed portraits, it’s the one thing that’s always close to my heart.<br>
          I love experimenting with pens, colors, and digital art, too! It’s the little things—like finishing a drawing at 2 am or doodling my favorite things—that make life so beautiful.

        <p>
          Capturing beautiful moments and stories through my lens is something I deeply enjoy. Photography lets me see the world in a new light and saves memories forever.<br>
          I adore portrait shots and candid smiles, but I also love photographing landscapes and all the little details that make life colorful!
